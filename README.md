## About The Project
As with our overall health, mental health influences the way that you function from day to day. This is why it is so important to care about mental health. If you do not take care of your mental health, you could find it challenging to work, build healthy relationships, and even leave your home. According to World Health Organization (WHO), there has been a 13 percent rise in mental health conditions and substance use disorders worldwide in the last decade. Based on the estimates of the WHO, approximately 7.5% of the Indian population is suffering from any kind of mental illness. Mentally is designed to help in spreading Mental health awareness. It has the feature of recommending treatment to a person by getting info about their daily routine and work life. It is a small step toward helping people to get aware of mental health and providing them resources in doing so.

So it predicts whether the user needs a mental health treatment or not by getting some basic info regarding their daily routine and work life.
